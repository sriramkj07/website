## About Me 
Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sriram (Shhri - Rahhm), I build products, I cycle, I love reading books and have a great fondness for stand-up com(ics)edy. I currently build products at ServiceNow. 

I'm fascinated by powerful network effects enabled by tech and how it disrupts traditional markets. I aspire to build such large scale platforms for the future.

I hope to write about some of these interests and showcase my builds.  

## Books
Also, I try to maintain an active list of books I read each year, my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103894258-sriram) if you want to be **book buddies!** 

Find me online: You can find and connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramkj/) or
Email: [kothandaraman.s@northeastern.edu](kothandaraman.s@northeastern.edu) or Twitter: [@sriram0_7](https://x.com/Sriram0_7) happy to talk and debate about anything ranging from books, product, tech and my very recent love for basketball!
